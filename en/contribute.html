<p>This site has been designed with data from a few local councils and regions of Cameroon but there is still work to do to complete the image of Cameroon's spending and you can help... Whether you are a local councillor or a concerned citizen, get involved and upload data for your region!</p>

<h3>Get Involved</h3>

<p>Anyone can contribute their local council's data, visualise it and link it to the map based navigation. The aim is to get as complete a picture of Cameroon's finance as possible, and to keep building this up as a resource, contributing data year on year. Here's how:</p>

<h4>Get your data into the OpenSpending Format</h4>

<p>Follow <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_rkkAD0X-7uJg1SzTJdSfCS5ZWqshMihdr6WZgcQPwo/edit#heading=h.4c0petnshpj8">the guidelines</a> to learn what you are aiming for. If you want to see what some sample data could look like, take a look at the <a href="http://bit.ly/LuxGjm">template</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the modifications can be done in a spreadsheet program such as Excel, however there are more powerful tools which can help with large-scale transformations such as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/">Google Refine</a>. Read the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bD3KztcPdc3Ffe5_xlVl--N2wBVydUtpUDJpq2d6sK8/edit#heading=h.d1ub48are7ej">Google Refine tutorial</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>Upload your data to the web</h4>

<p>Next, you need to get your CSV file online. There are numerous ways to do this, Dropbox, exporting your data directly from a Google Docs (File > Publish to the Web > Publish a CSV). We've used the DataHub to publish our data. If you've never used it before here's a quick demo of how to upload a dataset.</p>

<p>The video below details how this can be done:</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/43720463" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/43720463">Uploading Data to the DataHub</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/okf">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<h4>Import your data into OpenSpending</h4>

<p>Next add information about your dataset to make it easily findable in OpenSpending. Again, the video tutorial below walks you through doing this:</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/43259079" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/43259079">OpenSpending Upload: Stage 1</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/okf">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>Further related information is available on the <a href="http://openspending.org/help/data-loading.html">OpenSpending site</a>.

<h4>Create a model for your data</h4>

<p>Next, tell OpenSpending how to understand your data by creating a model.</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/43760979" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/43760979">OpenSpending Upload: Step 2 - Create a Model</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/okf">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>If that's all gone well, you'll be able to move on to creating visualisations (video coming soon - watch this space!) and if not and you have some errors watch the video below to see what to do next.</p>

<h4>Fix any errors</h4>

<p>It doesn't always go right the first time you try and load your data - here's what to do if you have made a mistake either in your model or your data.</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/43762097" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/43762097">How to Fix Errors in OpenSpending</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/okf">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<h4>Visualisations</h4>

<p>Now you are finished, and visualisations will automatically be generated from the data you uploaded into OpenSpending. All you have to do is:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Link up the data to Cameroon.OpenSpending.org. There is a tutorial on this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kc7TcT6mE2D_cNBHd2pK8GuhrziKWQjYihtrxlTGdPc/edit">here</a></li>
    <li>If you are adding data for a new region of Cameroon (as opposed to new data relating to a new financial year for an area of Cameroon which already has a map selector) - you will need to create a new sub-national map selector. Instructions on how to do this can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c0mJDOdfNOqsirYKDC96adHBi0W2bKicNyiI6w1xHVg/edithere">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
